1. Reflect on (think about) the work you did for the challenge. How did you do? What did you get right? What did you get wrong? What did you do differently (and possibly better) than what was posted in the solution? What was hard to do?

  -I did very well on this assignment, my project was completely functional, and every feature worked correctly. I know the project wasnt perfect though. One thing I noticed is that my checkerboard does not load as fast. It could have been a problem with my listener, but I notice that every time I enlarge the window too quickly, there is a tiny bit of white space inbetween the checkerboard and the edge of the window, showing that the checkerboard doesnt reload as quick when the window is resized. I think the listener was the hardest, because I struggled a lot with getting the window to display the whole checkerboard for a long time. I managed to fix it in time, but for the longest time, there were a few centimeters of the grid getting cut off of the bottom, and it was probably a math or listener error of mine.

2. How well did you understand the programming concepts and foundational knowledge needed to complete the challenge?

  -I understood the programming concepts very well, such as using MVC to communicate between the model and the controller to display the correct data on the view. The only thing that was annoying to me was setting up the checkerboard in an anchorpane rather than a gridpane used in class.
  
3. How well did you meet the requirements as set out in the challenge? What requirements did you not meet correctly (if any)?

  -I fully met the requirements of this assignment. Everything specified was present and functional.

4. How well does your solution match the posted solution? What is different?

  -Everything matches besides the loading error with the white space inbetween the window and the checkerboard when the window is resized too quickly. The code, on the other hand, is a lot different. Our build functions are a lot different, aswell as our functions in the controller. I used a separate function for each color and size of the grid, while you used switch statements.

5. How could you improve going forward? What don't you still understand that was required for the challenge?

  -I could improve by spending more time debugging and learning exactly why my window had the white space error.
